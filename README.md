# Deep Gender Recognizer

#### A Plain Demonstration of Gender Recognition Using Deep Neural Network

[Egami](https://github.com/MinhasKamal/Egami) and [Intellectron](https://github.com/MinhasKamal/Intellectron). 

As the name explains this project detects gender from image using deep learning. There is no image processing here. For image reading we used [Egami](https://github.com/MinhasKamal/Egami), and accomplished machine learning part with [Intellectron](https://github.com/MinhasKamal/Intellectron).

### How to Run?

1. Download [Deep Gender Recognizer](), and [import]() it in your IDE.
2. Download [Egami.jar](https://github.com/MinhasKamal/Egami/blob/release/Egami-V0.1.jar?raw=true) from project-  and [Intellectron.jar](https://github.com/MinhasKamal/Intellectron/releases/download/release/Intellectron-V0.1.jar) from project- , and [integrate](https://stackoverflow.com/a/3280451/4684058) them in the project's build path.
3. Now simply run [DeepGenderRecognizer.java](https://github.com/MinhasKamal/DeepGenderRecognizer/blob/master/src/com/minhaskamal/deepGenderRecognizer/DeepGenderRecognizer.java), and training should start. Several sections in this class are commented, by activating each section we can perform- training, testing, and prediction.
